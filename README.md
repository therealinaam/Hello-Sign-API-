# HelloSign API Project

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by a teammate's idea. The API used this time is "HelloSign API", which is mainly good at exchanging contracts and pdf. When I was thinking about what form of contract to take for this project, I came up with the idea of having to show the doctor's signature to the teacher when I was in high school. If I could easily get medical signatures and download them in the pdf format I wanted, I would have liked stronger security. We planned this project to embody these ideas.

## What it does
### Signature Conservation:

### Login Form

### create/upload/open folder with the pdf

### view/search through people who already signed

### request signature from someone new OR download signed pdf of someone who already signed

### request approved/signed

### download anytime
