# HelloSign API Project

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by a teammate's idea. The API used this time is "HelloSign API", which is mainly good at exchanging contracts and pdf. When I was thinking about what form of contract to take for this project, I came up with the idea of having to show the doctor's signature to the teacher when I was in high school. If I could easily get medical signatures and download them in the pdf format I wanted, I would have liked stronger security. We planned this project to embody these ideas.

## What it does
### Signature Conservation:

### Login Form
This platform includes login service that allows user to check which document they created and uploaded. It is created by streamlit that enables me to have web application feature in this project. 

### Create/upload/open folder with the pdf

### View/search through people who already signed

### Request signature from someone new OR download signed pdf of someone who already signed

### Request approved/signed
If you request a contract, you will be notified by email as shown in the image below. The other party can click the link in this email to go to the HelloSign API home page and sign the document they want you to sign. Once the document is signed, the person requesting the contract will receive a notification similar to the image below, allowing them to review the document.
